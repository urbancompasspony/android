Download and Install the PiDeploy APK
Tap the Options menu (Three dots ⋮ at top right of screen)
Tap New Deployment
After a few moments the Raspbian Image will download and install to your device.
When deployment is complete, tap [ ▷ START ] to launch the instance.
The instance will provide you with a password for Pi-hole admin, SSH and RDP access (Username: android, see screenshot below)

Note: The password appears only once when the image is deployed, make sure you record this information.
Hint: The password text can be copy/pasted to other Android apps (like Remote Desktop)

To install PIXEL Desktop, run pideploy-gui-install. Next time you login via RDP you will have a full desktop session with audio support.
$ pideploy-gui-install

For Nextcloud 27, run pideploy-nextcloud-install to launch the patched Nextcloudpi installer.
PiHole will change to :8080
$ pideploy-nextcloud-install
