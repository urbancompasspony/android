After a few moments the Raspbian Image will download and install to your device.
When deployment is complete, tap [ â–· START ] to launch the instance.

The instance will provide you with a password for Pi-hole admin, SSH and RDP access (Username: android, see screenshot below)
Note: The password appears only once when the image is deployed, make sure you record this information.
Hint: The password text can be copy/pasted to other Android apps (like Remote Desktop)

Login SSH and change SYSTEM and PIHOLE passwords!
$ passwd
$ pihole setpasswd

To install PIXEL Desktop, run pideploy-gui-install. Next time you login via RDP you will have a full desktop session with audio support.
$ pideploy-gui-install

$ exit
STOP system!
Start again.
Login SSH again.

For Nextcloud 27, run pideploy-nextcloud-install to launch the patched Nextcloudpi installer.

First: Visit https://your_IP/activate/  https://nextcloudpi.local/ (also https://nextcloudpi.lan/ or https://nextcloudpi/ on windows and mac) to activate your instance of NC, and save the auto generated passwords.
AFTER THIS you may review or reset them anytime by using:
$ nc-admin
$ nc-passwd.

Further config:
$ sudo ncp-config
or Web: https://IP:4443/

You can run letsencrypt to get rid of the warning if you have a (sub)domain available.
